## __The Hidden Crisis We Don’t Talk About Enough__

When people hear about foodborne illness, they think of bad luck — the wrong salad, the wrong meal, the wrong day. But the real story is much bigger, much darker, and far more expensive.

Produce contamination isn’t just making people sick, It’s __destroying entire harvests__, shutting down farms, wiping out cold storage inventories, and sending millions of pounds of safe food straight into dumpsters.

And all of it — the illness, the loss, the waste — is preventable.

## __The Numbers Don’t Lie: This is a System Out of Control__

- Produce recalls and contamination events cost the U.S. __billions of dollars every year__.  

- The average recall costs __$10 million+__, but major national recalls can easily exceed __$50 million__ once lawsuits and brand loss are included.  

- Foodborne illnesses connected to produce contribute to __over $15 billion__ in annual healthcare and productivity losses.  

- Recalls in 2024 alone led to nearly __$2 billion__ in destruction, recovery, logistics, and waste.  

- Every outbreak leads to the destruction of __entire fields, entire processing days, and entire warehouse inventories__, even when 95% of that food is perfectly safe.  


This isn’t inefficient — it’s catastrophic.

## __Real Lives Lost — Real Food Lost__

When a produce outbreak hits, two tragedies happen at once:

### __1. People get sick — sometimes fatally__

- Multi-state romaine outbreaks with multiple deaths  

- Salmonella-contaminated onions sending families to the ER  

- Listeria in salad kits causing miscarriages and severe illness

These families never see it coming.

### __2. Millions of pounds of safe produce are destroyed overnight__

Because the system can’t identify the exact source of contamination, entire lots, fields, and regions are thrown away “out of caution.”

In some outbreaks, crops from multiple states were uprooted, composted, or sent to landfills because there was no verified, real-time traceability to isolate the bad lot from the safe ones.

The human cost is devastating. The waste is staggering.

## __Why Does This Keep Happening?__

Because produce is the perfect storm for confusion:

- It’s grown outdoors — unpredictable environments  

- Water sources can carry contaminants  

- Workers handle thousands of units per hour  

- Equipment is shared across batches  

- Labels, pallets, and logistics systems are inconsistent  

- And the supply chain changes hands over a dozen times

__Confusion compounds at every step. __By the time someone discovers a problem, the food is already in trucks, warehouses, stores, and homes. So the industry does the only thing it can:  
 __destroy everything.__

# __The ALETHRA™ Solution: Clarity From Soil to Shelf__

ALETHRA™ eliminates the confusion that creates both human tragedy and massive food waste.

### __1. Live Contamination Detection — Where It Actually Happens__

ALETHRA™ SENSE detects microbial, chemical, and residue threats in fields, wash lines, and packing operations instantly.

One contaminated patch? Just that patch gets stopped — not the entire harvest.

### __2. Verified Sanitation and Equipment Integrity__

Every wash tank, conveyor, cooler, and blade must pass ALETHRA’s verification. If something falls below standard, ALETHRA™ prevents the batch from moving forward.

### __3. End-to-End Lot-Level Traceability__

With ALETHRA™ FLOW, every micro-batch of produce is tracked through:

- Harvest  

- Washing  

- Cooling  

- Packing  

- Distribution  

- Retail  

- Consumer touchpoints

When an outbreak hits, ALETHRA™ isolates __exactly__ which lots, pallets, and cases must be pulled — and which ones must __never__ be wasted.

### __4. One Unified Truth Layer for the Entire Supply Chain__

No more conflicting logs. No more inconsistent labels. No more “we don’t know where this came from.” ALETHRA™ creates a single clear record from soil to shelf.

# __What Would Have Happened With ALETHRA™__

- Contamination caught __before__ leaving the farm  

- Illness prevented  

- Deaths prevented  

- Massive recalls reduced to targeted removals  

- Millions of pounds of perfectly safe produce __saved  
__
- Farmers protected  

- Brands protected  

- Waste slashed  

- Costs cut  

- Confidence restored

ALETHRA™ doesn’t just protect people — it protects the planet by ending avoidable food destruction.

# __A Message From Our Founder & President, Chad Willis__

“Every outbreak we read about — every hospitalization, every death, every warehouse full of good food thrown away — is a reminder of why ALETHRA™ exists.

This isn’t a technology race. This is a humanity race.

We’re wasting billions of dollars in safe food every year because the systems can’t tell the difference between danger and confusion. And people are getting sick — or worse — because no one has a verified truth-layer from farm to fork.

ALETHRA™ changes that.

We bring the intelligence, the clarity, and the visibility that agriculture has been missing. We prevent the pain families go through, and we stop the unnecessary destruction of food in a world where too many people are hungry.

Our mission is simple:

Protect people.  
Protect food.  
Protect the future.

One system. One truth. Zero confusion.”
