## __The Crisis We Don’t Want to Admit__

Every parent believes one thing when they send their child to school:

__“My kids are safe.”__

But in thousands of public schools across the country, the greatest hidden threat isn’t violence or weather — it’s confusion inside the school food system.

Mislabeling. Cross-contamination. Allergens hiding in the wrong products. Expired items mixed with fresh inventory. Vendors shipping incorrect cases to the wrong schools. Staff receiving products with unreadable or conflicting dates.

And the result?

__Children — our most vulnerable population — getting sick from food that should have never reached their tray. And mountains of perfectly safe food thrown away because no one trusts the data.__

# __The Numbers Are Devastating__

## __Children Are Getting Sick — A Lot__

Across U.S. public schools:

- School cafeterias experienced __114 documented foodborne-illness outbreaks__ in less than a decade.  

- These outbreaks sickened __5,799 students__ and caused __246 hospitalizations__ — children who were simply trying to eat lunch.  

- Many of these events were tied directly to __mislabeling, supplier confusion, storage errors, or poor traceability__.

And this is only what’s recorded. Most school-related illnesses are never formally reported.

## __The Waste Is Even Worse__

Food waste in schools is at crisis levels:

- U.S. schools throw away an estimated __530,000 tons of food every year__.  

- That waste costs the education system __up to $9.7 million per day__ when you factor in food cost, disposal fees, storage losses, and spoiled inventory.  

- In some districts, plate-waste studies show that __over 50% of vegetables and entrées__ are thrown away untouched.  

- This means millions of pounds of food — much of it perfectly safe — are destroyed because the system cannot verify freshness, origin, or integrity.

The cafeteria is one of the most wasteful points in the entire U.S. food supply chain.

## __Global Perspective: Our Kids Are Part of a Much Bigger Problem__

Foodborne contamination isn’t just an American failure — it’s a worldwide epidemic. Globally, contaminated food causes:

- __600 million illnesses__ each year  

- __420,000 deaths__  
__
- Children under 5 suffer __40% of all foodborne disease__, even though they make up just 9% of the population

In the U.S. alone:

- Major foodborne pathogens cause __9.9 million illnesses__,  

- __53,300 hospitalizations__, and  

- __931 deaths every single year__

When bad food hits schools, children pay the price. And parents never see it coming.

# __Why These Failures Keep Happening__

These tragedies aren’t caused by lack of care — they’re caused by __lack of clarity__. School food systems break down because:

- Suppliers deliver food with inconsistent or unreadable labels  

- Lots and cases are mixed during distribution  

- Allergens end up in supposedly “safe” products  

- Dairy-free, gluten-free, and peanut-free items are mislabeled  

- Storage temperatures are not verified at every handoff  

- Shipping errors cause the wrong products to land in the wrong schools  

- Administrators must destroy entire truckloads of food when only a single case may be compromised

__Confusion becomes the failure mode — and children become the victims.__

# __The Human Cost: Stories That Should Never Exist__

A mislabeled container of dairy-free yogurt that actually contains dairy. A salad batch mixed with contaminated produce. A case of spoiled chicken that made it past inconsistent storage logs. A shipment of “safe” allergen-free snacks that caused anaphylaxis in students.

All preventable. All caused by missing clarity. All creating more waste and more fear.

# __ALETHRA™: The Clarity Platform That Stops These Failures Cold__

## __1. Real-Time Food Safety Verification__

ALETHRA™ SENSE checks:

- Freshness  

- Temperature history  

- Allergen accuracy  

- Microbial and residue risk  

- Label consistency

All of this *before* the food ever reaches a child’s plate.

## __2. Verified Distribution From Farm to Cafeteria__

ALETHRA™ FLOW tracks:

- Lot numbers  

- Supplier identity  

- Case movements  

- Storage conditions  

- Delivery routes

If an error occurs anywhere, ALETHRA™ identifies the exact batches — not the entire shipment.

## __3. Instant Alerts for Dangerous or Confusing Food Products__

If a product is:

- Mislabeled  

- Incorrectly routed  

- Carried at wrong temperatures  

- Sent from an unverified supplier  

- Misdated or suspicious

ALETHRA™ stops it immediately.

## __4. Preventing Massive Waste__

With verified clarity:

- Schools no longer throw away safe inventory  

- District budgets stabilize  

- Parents trust school meals again  

- Millions of pounds of food stay out of landfills  

- Children get the nutritious meals they deserve

Clarity doesn’t just protect health — it protects the planet.

# __What Would Have Happened With ALETHRA™__

- Allergen errors caught at delivery  

- Contaminated produce intercepted before distribution  

- Wrong-case shipments flagged instantly  

- Mislabeled items rejected automatically  

- School-wide recalls reduced to __single-lot__ corrections  

- Hundreds of thousands of tons of food saved  

- Millions of dollars preserved  

- Children kept safe

ALETHRA™ transforms school food systems from confusion-driven to precision-driven.

# __A Message From Our Founder & President, Chad Willis__

“When children get sick from school food, it’s not just a failure — it’s a betrayal of trust. These kids don’t control the supply chain. They don’t check labels. They don’t manage temperature logs. They’re just hungry and trusting.

When the system fails, the child suffers.

I built ALETHRA™ to protect the people who have no voice in these decisions. No school should have to guess if the food they’re serving is safe. No child should get sick because of a misread label. No district should throw away millions of dollars in food because they can’t verify where it came from.

Clarity saves lives. Clarity prevents waste. Clarity protects our children. And ALETHRA™ will deliver that clarity — everywhere it’s needed.”
