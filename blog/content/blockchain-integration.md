**Mérida, Mexico — 05 November 2025 —** ==ALETHRA== Inc. today announced the creation of a new global safety category: Clarity Technology™ — a revolutionary framework and platform designed to eliminate confusion before it causes harm.

For decades, industries have advanced regulation and automation, yet one critical cause of loss and injury remains largely unaddressed: human confusion.

Every year, look-alike packaging, labeling mix-ups, and simple visual misreads cause billions in waste, millions of recalls, and thousands of preventable injuries and deaths.

==ALETHRA==™ changes that by introducing the world’s first *clarity layer* — an AI-driven system that sees, understands, and prevents confusion in real time.

## A New Category in Safety

Clarity Technology™ is a completely new class of safety system focused on preventing confusion-based harm before it happens.  
It transforms compliance from a static requirement into a living, intelligent safety layer that ensures what people see, they truly understand.

> “Confusion is invisible until it causes harm,” said **Chad Willis**, Creator of ==ALETHRA==™ and CEO of ==ALETHRA== Inc. 
> “We built ==ALETHRA==™ to make clarity visible — measurable, teachable, and universal. For the first time, safety can be proactive, not reactive.”


## The MyALETHRA™ App — Clarity for Everyone

The My==ALETHRA==™ app brings the power of industrial clarity directly to individuals.  
It allows users to scan and verify medications, beverages, or packaged foods instantly — confirming that what they are about to take, drink, or share is correct, safe, and unspoiled.

**Use cases include:**
- **In healthcare:** verify correct medicine and dosage.
- **In food safety:** detect freshness or labeling inconsistencies.
- **In everyday life:** prevent accidental mix-ups of similar products.

My==ALETHRA==™ is available in beta on the App Store and Google Play.  
Early access registration is open at [www.MyALETHRA.com](http://www.MyALETHRA.com).



## How the ==ALETHRA==™ Platform Works

The ==ALETHRA== ecosystem connects multiple systems into one clarity infrastructure:

- **ALETHRACAM™ / ALETHRASCAN™** – Visual verification tools for hospitals, factories, and field use.  
- **ALETHRACLOUD™** – Secure AI environment for learning, fingerprinting, and compliance data.  
- **MyALETHRA™ App** – Consumer and professional interface for real-world clarity verification.  
- **ALETHRACERTIFIED™** – Official trust seal verifying measurable Clarity • Compliance • Safety.

Together, these components create a seamless clarity network — preventing errors, capturing clarity data, and driving safer decision-making across industries and households.

## Solving the Global Confusion Crisis

Confusion is one of the most pervasive and preventable threats to human safety:

- **In hospitals:** patients receive the wrong medicine because of similar packaging.  
- **In food and beverage:** mislabeled or expired products are consumed daily.  
- **In manufacturing:** batch confusion causes shutdowns, losses, and recalls.  
- **In homes:** shared products and look-alike containers cause accidental misuse.

==ALETHRA==™ addresses these risks through one unified clarity framework — protecting people and products from production to personal use.

## Regulatory and Standards Alignment

==ALETHRA==™ complements existing safety systems within recognized frameworks:

- FDA – Safe Use Initiative & Human Factors Engineering  
- NIST – AI Risk Management Framework  
- WHO – Global Patient Safety Challenge  
- GS1 – Product identity and traceability  
- ISO & EPA – Quality, sustainability, and waste-reduction standards  

## ==ALETHRACERTIFIED==™ – The New Global Standard

The **==ALETHRACERTIFIED==™** mark is the new global symbol of verified clarity.  
Products, facilities, and systems meeting ==ALETHRA==’s stringent benchmarks earn certification — representing the highest commitment to Clarity, Compliance, and Safety.

## Human, Economic, and Environmental Impact

Confusion costs more than money — it costs trust, time, and lives.

By preventing misreads and mix-ups before they happen, ALETHRA™ creates measurable impact:

- Lives saved through error prevention.  
- Billions saved from avoided recalls and waste.  
- Environmental protection via reduced disposal of misidentified goods.

> “==ALETHRA==™ isn’t just a platform — it’s a shift in how the world defines safety,” added Willis.  
> “From hospitals to homes, from packaging to people, ==ALETHRA==™ brings clarity where it’s needed most.”
